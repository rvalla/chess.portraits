# chessboard portraits

This is the code I use to make my series of **chessboard portraits**. Some of my photography work inspired
by chess...  

## running the code

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): the programming language I used.  
- [**python-chess**](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess): the library which helps me to process chess moves.
